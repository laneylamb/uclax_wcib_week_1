      Hi everyone, welcome to my website! My name is Delaney Lamb and I am a UCLAx student in the Design Communication Arts certificate program. My goal is to enter the field of graphic design and digital marketing. I love how the visual aesthetic of a brand can enhance its message and personalize its corner of the internet. From my humble 13-inch, 2016 MacBook Pro, I want to create designs that will have a global reach. Beyond my professional interests, I love all things health and fitness and have a passion for travel. My perfect day would include a HIIT workout, iced coffee, sunshine, the beach, and exploring somewhere new.

      As this website is the first that I have made, I had a few challenges setting it up. As I set up my local development environment in Atom, I was shocked to see blaring red error messages appear when I attempted to run Grunt. What I didn’t realize was that I did not have Developer’s Tools downloaded on my Mac, which prevented me from coding! When my husband (aka, coder extraordinaire) saw me in distress over these unexpected error messages, he quickly deciphered them and pointed out that a pop-up window had appeared with an option to download the necessary software. It was at that point that I realized how code is truly a new language I’m learning- what looked like complete and utter chaos to me was actually a simple instruction. Now I know that error messages don’t necessarily indicate impending doom and instead are asking me to calmly consider the obstacle at hand.

    <h5>A Few of My Favorite Places on the Internet:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com" title="YouTube" target="_blank">YouTube</a> - Education, entertainment, exercise… need I say more? I use YouTube daily for all of the above! My favorite channels are CinemaSins, Corridor Crew, NaturallyStefanie, Yoga with Adriene, and Tone It Up.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com" title="Pinterest" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> - Pinterest is what I call social media for introverts. For years I have loved creating online pinboards for planning and inspiration, and the minimal, easy-to-use interface paired with no expectation of direct communication between users is extremely relaxing. This site is also incredible for finding niche (and delicious) recipes- I highly recommend it if you have any food allergies or preferences.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.toneitup.com" title="ToneItUp" target="_blank">ToneItUp</a> - This girl-centric company is one of my favorite sources of fitspiration. Karena and Katrina have an empowering training style and their articles have changed my understanding of what it means to live a healthy, balanced lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>
